# LynnwoodTrafficPrediction
This is a project for my senior capstone project at University of Washington Bothell , c/o 2020. 

Project Title: 
Impacts on Lynnwood Transportation from Forecasted Link Light Rail Use

Overview:
This project will develop a traffic simulation model that will predict the use of the incoming Link Light Rail to Lynnwood in 2024. This model will be used to analyze how the predicted Link Light Rail use will impact road traffic/travel times, bus use, and its subsequent environmental impacts. I also plan to analyze the potential new revenue stream for the city and apply this to future transportation projects.

Goals:
- Predict and analyze future traffic flow based on existing data
- Predict and visualize the impact of predicted light-rail use on vehicle traffic
- Determine optimal light-rail ridership to decrease road congestion on major roads in Lynnwood
- Analyze the revenue stream from the light-rail and apply this money to city projects 
- Understand and interpret the environmental impacts of the light-rail ridership (Reduced CO2 emissions from cars vs. land-use vs. emissions from unused light-rail trains, etc)
